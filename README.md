# Website Scraper with BeautifulSoup

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to **scrape a website** using the Python library **BeautifulSoup**.  
The script performs two main tasks:
1. **Scrapes the entire HTML content** of a chosen website.
2. **Extracts and prints all image links** found on the site.

This could serve as a foundation for future **Machine Learning** or **Data Science** projects that require image datasets or web content extraction.
